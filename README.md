## Self Reflection

Throughout the last 24 hours I have learned a substantial amount in regards to formatting and creating an HTML page.
I have incorporated various aspects such as wrapping,
parent and child tags.
I am presently working on my Odin Project recipes, finding it somewhat mundane.
I look forward to when I can incorporate some CSS and JS into this!

## Looking Ahead

I would like to jump on CSS and JS as soon as possible. Adding some script functionality to my front-end would be nice!
I'm also hoping this job offer-like situation pulls through. It's my dream to work formally in IT. Rather than struggle as a freelancer as I lack experience and network growth.
